Documentation on how to use to program.

# Interface
When you run the executable file, the program will start and appear like this:

![Image could not be loaded!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corv1njano/Display-Entities-Scripts/refs/heads/main/docs/img/app.PNG "Title")

Features:
- **Command**: Paste the entity display command here, but remove the slash at the beginning. The output will be a .mcfunction file, and commands within this file should not have a slash at the start.
- **Block Type**: Choose "Change Color" if you want to create different color varients for your model. Choose "Chnge Wood" to create different wood varients. The default value to be replace is color "white" and wood "oak".
- **Target**: If color mode is chosen, select the target block variant to replace.
- **Replacement**: If color mode is chosen, select the block that replaces the target. If the target should not be replaced, select the replacement block type to be the same as the target block.
- **Filename**: Choose a filename for your files. For example, if you choose "chair" as the filename, the output will be "red_chair.mcfunction", "blue_chair.mcfunction", etc.

# Generate Files
If all the settings are to your liking, click the "Generate Filesâ€¦" button. All the files will be generated and placed in the same directory as your .exe file.
